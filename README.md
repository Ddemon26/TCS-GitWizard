# Overview

**TCS GitWizard** is a Unity plugin to centralize management of Git repository URLs for Unity projects. It allows developers to store and manage all Git URLs in one place, simplifying project setups and reducing manual work. By integrating into the Unity Editor, it streamlines handling Git-based package links.

The primary purpose is to centralize Git-based Unity packages, much like the Unity Package Manager for store assets. This plugin automates installation, updates, and management of packages via a unified interface, making it particularly useful for teams.
